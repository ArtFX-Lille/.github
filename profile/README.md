<p>

Welcome to the official **ArtFX Lille GitHub**. Its goal is to ensure long-term maintainability, data integrity, and controlled access across successive ArtFX student promotions. <br>

2. Send a message to an administrator/moderator of the **ArtFX Lille GitHub** either by e-mail or through the Discord of your L5 promotion.
3. He will send your an inventation to collaborate on the GitHub as a member. The invitation will be in your emails.
4. Click on the "Accept Invitation" button inside the mail. *(note that a GitHub invitation can only last 7 days. So please be reactive, otherwise, the moderator/administrator will have to resend you an invitation.)*

[Contributors List](CONTRIBUTING.md)

L4 students will get acces to their **own repository**, based on the `artfxLillePipeline_template` when they'll start the production of their **test shot for their end of studies film, starting on April**. <br>

**ℹ️ It's not possible for L4 students to ask to get acces to the L5 repository. Don't ask the authorization to an administrator before you receive your own repository. Be patient.** <br>

Every single student will get viewing access to the `artfxLillePipeline_archive`, for tracability and researches.
