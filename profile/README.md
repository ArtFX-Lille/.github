# ArtFX Lille GitHub
<p>

Welcome to the official **ArtFX Lille GitHub**. Its goal is to ensure long-term maintainability, data integrity, and controlled access across successive ArtFX student promotions. <br>
As a public member, you get access **ONLY to the official** documentation of the workflows, tools and pipeline of the current L5 promotion. <br>

**If you are in L5** and you wish to participate in building the pipeline for your current promotion, send a message to an administrator of the **ArtFX Lille GitHub** either by e-mail or through the Discord of your L5 promotion. <br>

L4 students will get acces to their **own repository**, based on the `artfxLillePipeline_template` when they'll start the production of their **test shot in April**. <br>

**ℹ️ It's not possible for L4 students to ask to get acces to the L5 repository. Don't ask the authorization to an administrator before you reveive your own repository. Be patient.** <br>

Every single student will get viewing access to the `artfxLillePipeline_archive`, for tracability and researches.
